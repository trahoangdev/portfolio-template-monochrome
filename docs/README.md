## 🎨 Customization Guide

### 1. Global Branding
Edit `src/data/config.js`. This is the heart of the template. It controls:
- Your Name & Nickname (Logo)
- Bio & Professional details
- Social Media URL redirects
- Contact Information (Phone, Email, Location)
- SEO Meta-tags (OG images, descriptions)

### 2. Projects & Skills
- **Projects**: Manage your portfolio items in `src/data/projects.js`.
- **Skills**: Add or remove your tech stack in `src/data/skills.js`.

### 3. Writing Blog Posts
Posts are stored in `public/posts/`. 
- Create a `.md` file with a slug (e.g., `my-post.md`).
- Register the post in `src/components/Blog.js` to show it on the grid.

### 4. Theme Colors
To change the accent colors or glass intensity, edit the variables in `src/index.css`. Look for:
```css
:root {
  --primary-accent: #ffffff; /* Example: Change to #00ff00 for a Neon look */
  --glass-backdrop: blur(10px);
}
```

## 📦 Deployment

1. Set the build command: `npm run build`.
2. Output directory: `build`.
3. **Environment Variables**: Make sure to add `REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`, etc., in your hosting dashboard (Vercel/Netlify).
